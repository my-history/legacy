===

"Mymotherland" – it is educational historical web-site, which is developing for improving level of knowledge Russians about history of their country. This project is about people, made parts of our big Motherland so unique, about buildings and memorials, which wanna look peoples all around the world, about most obscure streets, which knows not every inhabitant and about how WW2 changed life of all country

Testing made composed of simple historical questions linked with Ivanovo region that are held before the start of development showed the most of citizens of textile region had a worse knowlegde about the easiest facts about their history

This study clarified the mission of the projec: collect in comfort shape local history facts and articles about different regions for everyone.

I was classifying key features of the project: readability (include cool design and opportunity of access from almost all devices), different feautures, need to simplify interactions with site (preferences panel, intuitive navigation), compliteness and simple presentation of the material
